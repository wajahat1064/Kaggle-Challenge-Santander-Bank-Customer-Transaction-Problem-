**Intro and Business Problem**:

**Santander Bank needs to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted**. 

The data provided for this competition has the **same** structure as the **real data** they have available to solve this problem.

The data is anonimyzed, each row containing **200 numerical values** identified just with a number.  

In the jupyter notebook file, we will be **exploring the data**, **preparing it for a LightGBM model**, **training and cross-validating the LightGBM model** and **predicting the target value for the test set**.

Dataset can be obtained directly from the Kaggle Competition:
